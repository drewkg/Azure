# Introduction 
This repository holds the Azure Image Builder ARM templates and necessary scripts required to initialize the DriveTrain Azure DevOps Build Agents.

Drivetrain has some specific requirements, mainly around specific versions of Powershell modules, because of this it is necessary to host managed Azure DevOps Agents created from specific images.  The Azure Image Builder Service is being used to create golden images, that can then be used to create VM's that are always identical between instances.
