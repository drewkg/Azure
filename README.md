# Azure

This repository holds a general collection of Azure resources I have found useful over time, they are meant to be generalized and used as an inspiration rather than verbotim.  It is my personal repository for resources that I have created in my own time.  Some of the resources are in response to people asking question or things that interest me and I just wat to try something out.

The repo holds ARM templaces and where of interest new BICEP representations too.  The naming convention used within the resources are similar to the Microsoft best practice, but with a major difference.  Please see [Naming Convention](./docs/Convetions.md) for more information.

Everyone is welcome to use the artifacts in this repository, in anyway you want, I make no statement as to the fit of the artifacts.  If you really want then also feel free to contribute to the repository, but I really don't expect that anyone will.

You will occasionally find the files referenced from by Blog as well.
