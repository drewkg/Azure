# Azure

This repository holds a general collection of Azure resources I have found useful over time, they are meant to be generalized and used as an inspiration rather than verbotim.

The repo holds ARM templaces and where of interest new BICEP representations too.  The naming convention used within the resources are similar to the Microsoft best practice, but with a major difference.  Please see (Naming Convention)[./docs/Convetions.md] for more information.
